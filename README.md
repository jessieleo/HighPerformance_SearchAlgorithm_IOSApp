- This project which is an instant search with a given prefix via search bar shows cities to users by clicking can go to the location.
- I am using binary search and only searching the subsequence when the user adds another character so performance is efficient regarding to even swift high order    functions.
- No storyboard and not detailed ui working because the main target was focusing on instant search performance and memory usage
- Includes Xcode Unit test for true and false searchings
- Includes all diacritical marks such as é,è,ê etc.
