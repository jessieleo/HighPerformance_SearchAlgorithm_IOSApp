- This project which is an instant search with a given prefix via search bar shows cities to users by clicking can go to the location.
- Searching is more efficient, I am using search and only searching the subsequence when the user adds another character.
- No storyboard and not detailed ui working because the main target was focusing on instant search performance.
- Includes Xcode Unit test for true and false searchings
